### Hi there 👋
### I’m Elham — Data Scientist, AI and Machine Learning Engineer
I have worked in both Data Science and AI. Since I have completed the master’s level courses in Data Science, I learned AI with a focus on Data Science fundamentals.


My skills cover 5 essential steps: statistics, mathematics, and theoretical data science topics; data cleaning and engineering; exploratory data analysis using visualization tools in Python and R; data modeling in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning; and hands-on project experience in NLP and working with LLMs—followed by final data interpretation. I have done all of this using Python and R.


You can view some of my projects on GitHub. Currently, I am co-founding the “Homa” chatbot and plan to launch it by next month.


I am also interested in writing articles about combining AI with any other discipline. If you’d like to discuss this, feel free to message me at the email address on my resume (Check me out @ https://elhamit.com) ☺️📩


My hobbies include taking online courses, coding, and watching movies. I love traveling—especially trips where I can walk along the beach.
